            <p>
            My name is Kaito.
I have been working as an iOS app programmer for 2 years now.

            <p className='title'>Programming</p>
            <p>
            I have loved building things since I was a child, and I like to create something with crafts.

            When I was in the fourth grade, my mom asked me if I wanted to try programming. This was the first time I came into contact with programming.
At first I was learning Python, but I couldn't see what I wanted to do with Python, so I decided to try another programming language.
Three years later, when I was in the first year of junior high school, I started to learn Swift for iOS app development.
